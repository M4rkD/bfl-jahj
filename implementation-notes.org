** snapped 
Two cols -> Type (LabelAtlas) and point (x/y coord)

Types are:
#+begin_src 
[1] Culvert       dam           Ford          Ramp/bed_sill sluice       
[6] unknown       weir         
#+end_src

** A point is:
   Print string
#+begin_src R
Geometry set for 0 features 
bbox:           xmin: NA ymin: NA xmax: NA ymax: NA
epsg (SRID):    2192

* buffBarriers
-> the snapped barriers are transformed to polygons
-> Two rows (LabelAtlas, geometry) and a row ID (e.g. 1.1, 1.2)
They're 1.x, 2.x, 3.x and 4.x

Still 5000 entries, second part of index is 5000, first part changes at:

1 - 1 -> 1250
2 - 1251 -> 2500
3 - 2501 -> 3750
4 - 3751 -> 5000

So, they're grouped (by processor I think! I have 4 processors)

Note, 1250 on each
* basinRivers
  ID_DRAIN
  NOM_RHT
  TOPONYME_R
  NOM_SIMPLI
  ID_TRHYD
  IDRHE
  len -> I think this might just be in meters or something
  basinID -> shared between multiple rows
  geometry -> linestring -> looks like a list of pairs of points
* diffRivers
This is where it gets interesting...
* IMPORTANT...!
** THE WORK IS DIVIDED EVENLY BY NUMBER, APRIORI - not in a queue/workers
